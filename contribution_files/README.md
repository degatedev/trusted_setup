# Trusted Setup contributions
We are honored to have Guoyu, Shannon Ewing, David Mihal, Toghrul Maharramov and Gulu as participants in the ceremony. Our Trusted Setup was completed with their contributions.

The community can verify their signed attestation file in the `signed_attestation` folder. At the same time, we have made the participants’ contribution files publicly available at the cloud storage. The community can verify the correctness of each participant’s contribution using the verification steps outlined at Coordinator.md#verify-the-contribution-file-of-every-participant. 
Moreover, based on these files, the community can also export the Proving Key (pk) and Verifying Key(vk), and verify vk against the configuration in the DeGate mainnet smart contracts.
